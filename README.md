  - Peer Coded: Brandon was the code typer.

## Approach Taken:

1. May 25 2021
    - Slow start with chosing the App idea, creating the backend, and the the front end.
    - Created the backend and the frontend.

2. May 26 2021
    - Rearrange the file structure, changed the paths in the App
    - Deployment to heroku was much easier than the backend. Major issue was we had forgotten to changed the paths url from localhost to the heroku backend url.
    - Reached MVP before lunch.
