## About:
  - Mood tracker app. Tracks the users moods. Charts the moods by year, month, and week.
  - Peer Coded: Brandon was the code typer.

## Approach Taken:

1. May 25 2021
    - Slow start with chosing the App idea, creating the backend, and the the front end.
    - Created the backend and the frontend.

2. May 26 2021
    - Rearrange the file structure, changed the paths in the App
    - Deployment to heroku was much easier than the backend. Major issue was we had forgotten to changed the paths url from localhost to the heroku backend url.
    - Reached MVP before lunch.
    - After Lunch, we had a scrum about the stretch features we wanted, came up with various plans to tackle the features efficiently while taking into consideration the mental state, burnout level, as well as our personal goal to complete our project with a day or two for self-care and/or to get a day ahead for final project week.
    - Decided to peer code: React Router and Chart.JS, Login Auth and CSS will be tackled by two members or the group.
    - Created a topic list for May 27th Scrum.
