## About
All The Feels is a Mood-Booster app with Full CRUD functionality and was built with a React frontend and a Django API server. This app was inspired by the emotional state that our team was in as project week began. If a user is not in the best of moods they will be able hop on to All The Feels to get a positive boost and maybe even have a laugh or two! This project was great experience working collaboratively in a React App with multiple components!

## Approach Taken

1. May 25 2021
    - Slow start with chosing the App idea, creating the backend, and the the front end.
    - Created the backend and the frontend.

2. May 26 2021
    - Rearrange the file structure, changed the paths in the App
    - Deployment to heroku was much easier than the backend. Major issue was we had forgotten to changed the paths url from localhost to the heroku backend url.
    - Reached MVP before lunch.
    - After Lunch, we had a scrum about the stretch features we wanted, came up with various plans to tackle the features efficiently while taking into consideration the mental state, burnout level, as well as our personal goal to complete our project with a day or two for self-care and/or to get a day ahead for final project week.
    - Decided to peer code: React Router and Chart.JS, Login Auth and CSS will be tackled by two members or the group.
    - Created a topic list for May 27th Scrum.


3. May 27 2021
   - Had a scrum meeting before we began the day to decided who will be tackling Auth(Brandon and Heath) and ChartJS(Ryani and Rachel).
   - Each team focused on their given stretch goal to focus on.

4. May 28 2021
   - Had another scrum meeting about the results of the focus efforts from yesterday.
   - Decided to toss Auth. Not wanting to touch hooks.
   - Decided to add a third party api to render some jokes on the 'Home' page.
   - Decided to create a comment section
   - Decided to have fun with CSS.....wanting to add fun hidden gems around the app. (happy plant must be added)

5. May 29 2021
    - Had another scrum meeting where we discussed what all we have done and what we have left to do. Realized we've reached several stretch goals and to focus on styling after making sure we deploy properly to Heroku.
    - Tidied up some code just semantically.
    - Still discussing more hidden gems around the app just for a laugh or two.
    ------WE LOVE STICKERS ON TRELLO------

6. May 30 2021
    - CSS was added. Peer Coded the CSS in order to make it responsive.

7. May 31 2021
   - Tied up any lose ends.


## Unsolved Problems / Future Updates
  - We wanted to integrate authentication but were not able to get it working.
  - We tried to use Chart.js so it would dynamically render user data but without authentication we were having a hard time using it.
  - Having a filter feature on our view page would be helpful.
  - Once authentication was implemented, we could add a journaling aspect to the app where a user can track their moods over a period of time and then we could give them their own mood chart.
  - We had wanted to have a collapsed side bar however, css has defeated me(R.T)
